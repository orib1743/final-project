# Final Project

This is my final project, where we are participating in a research study with a professor from the United States. The goal of the research is to utilize various NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to compare the U.S. tax codes from 2017 and 2018 and identify changes.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze and compare tax code documents from 2017 and 2018 using NLP methodologies.
- **Approach:** Apply different NLP techniques, such as text preprocessing, tokenization, named entity recognition, and similarity analysis.
- **Research Collaboration:** This project is part of an academic study conducted with a professor from the U.S.
- **Expected Outcome:** Identify and categorize the changes in tax laws between the two years.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK, or Transformers)
- Data processing (pandas, regex)
- Visualization tools (Matplotlib, seaborn)
