the near future, Congress by this action, recognizes the
importance of taking all reasonable means to restrain
Government spending and urges the President to declare

case, the day before the petition is filed).
(ii) Special rule for pass-thru entities
The rule of clause (i) shall also apply in
the case of the sale or exchange or redemption
of an interest in a partnership, S corporation,

return for a specified period on which an entry
has been made with respect to a tax imposed
under a provision of subtitle D (including a return
on which an entry has been made showing
no liability for such tax for such period) shall
constitute the filing of a return of all amounts
of such tax which, if properly paid, would be
required to be reported on such return for such
period.
(c) Exceptions
(1) False return
In the case of a false or fraudulent return
with the intent to evade tax, the tax may be

of such tax may be begun without assessment,
at any time.
(2) Willful attempt to evade tax
In case of a willful attempt in any manner
to defeat or evade tax imposed by this title
(other than tax imposed by subtitle A or B),
the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in
court for the collection of such tax may be
begun without assessment, at any time.

In the case of failure to file a return, the tax
may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for
the collection of such tax may be begun without
assessment, at any time.

Where, before the expiration of the time
prescribed in this section for the assessment
of any tax imposed by this title, except the
estate tax provided in chapter 11, both the
Secretary and the taxpayer have consented
in writing to its assessment after such time,
the tax may be assessed at any time prior to
the expiration of the period agreed upon.
The period so agreed upon may be extended
by subsequent agreements in writing made
before the expiration of the period previously
agreed upon.
(B) Notice to taxpayer of right to refuse or
limit extension
The Secretary shall notify the taxpayer of
the taxpayer’s right to refuse to extend the
period of limitations, or to limit such extension
to particular issues or to a particular
period of time, on each occasion when the
taxpayer is requested to provide such consent.
(5) Tax resulting from changes in certain income
tax or estate tax credits
For special rules applicable in cases where the adjustment
of certain taxes allowed as a credit against
income taxes or estate taxes results in additional
tax, see section 905(c) (relating to the foreign tax
credit for income tax purposes) and section 2016 (relating
to taxes of foreign countries, States, etc.,
claimed as credit against estate taxes).
(6) Termination of private foundation status
In the case of a tax on termination of private
foundation status under section 507, such
tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court
for the collection of such tax may be begun
without assessment, at any time.
(7) Special rule for certain amended returns
Where, within the 60-day period ending on
the day on which the time prescribed in this
section for the assessment of any tax imposed
by subtitle A for any taxable year would
otherwise expire, the Secretary receives a
written document signed by the taxpayer
showing that the taxpayer owes an additional
amount of such tax for such taxable year, the
period for the assessment of such additional
amount shall not expire before the day 60 days

after the date on which the Secretary is furnished

items related to such failure.

If any gift of property the value of which (or
any increase in taxable gifts required under
section 2701(d) which) is required to be shown
on a return of tax imposed by chapter 12 (without
regard to section 2503(b)), and is not shown
on such return, any tax imposed by chapter 12
on such gift may be assessed, or a proceeding
in court for the collection of such tax may be
begun without assessment, at any time. The
preceding sentence shall not apply to any item
which is disclosed in such return, or in a statement
attached to the return, in a manner adequate
to apprise the Secretary of the nature of
such item.

or statement for any taxable year any information

of the amount of gross income stated in
the return, or
(ii) such amount—
(I) is attributable to one or more assets

were applied without regard to the dollar
threshold specified in subsection (a)
thereof and without regard to any exceptions
provided pursuant to subsection

(II) is in excess of $5,000,
the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in

6 years after the return was filed.
(B) Determination of gross income
For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
(i) In the case of a trade or business, the
term ‘‘gross income’’ means the total of
the amounts received or accrued from the
sale of goods or services (if such amounts
are required to be shown on the return)
prior to diminution by the cost of such
sales or services;
(ii) An understatement of gross income
by reason of an overstatement of unrecovered
cost or other basis is an omission
from gross income; and
(iii) In determining the amount omitted
from gross income (other than in the case
of an overstatement of unrecovered cost or
other basis), there shall not be taken into
account any amount which is omitted
from gross income stated in the return if
such amount is disclosed in the return, or
§ 6501 TITLE 26—INTERNAL REVENUE CODE Page 3488
in a statement attached to the return, in a
manner adequate to apprise the Secretary
of the nature and amount of such item.
(C) Constructive dividends
If the taxpayer omits from gross income
an amount properly includible therein under
section 951(a), the tax may be assessed, or a
proceeding in court for the collection of such
tax may be done without assessing, at any
time within 6 years after the return was
filed.
(2) Estate and gift taxes
In the case of a return of estate tax under
chapter 11 or a return of gift tax under chapter

or from the total amount of the gifts made
during the period for which the return was
filed items includible in such gross estate or
such total gifts, as the case may be, as exceed
in amount 25 percent of the gross estate stated
in the return or the total amount of gifts stated
in the return, the tax may be assessed, or
a proceeding in court for the collection of such
tax may be begun without assessment, at any
time within 6 years after the return was filed.
In determining the items omitted from the
gross estate or the total gifts, there shall not
be taken into account any item which is omitted
from the gross estate or from the total
gifts stated in the return if such item is disclosed
in the return, or in a statement attached
to the return, in a manner adequate to
apprise the Secretary of the nature and
amount of such item.

may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for
the collection of such tax may be begun without
assessment, at any time within 6 years
after the return is filed. In determining the
amount of tax omitted on a return, there shall
not be taken into account any amount of tax
imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 which is
omitted from the return if the transaction giving
rise to such tax is disclosed in the return,
or in a statement attached to the return, in a
manner adequate to apprise the Secretary of
the existence and nature of such item.
(f) Personal holding company tax
If a corporation which is a personal holding
company for any taxable year fails to file with
its return under chapter 1 for such year a schedule
setting forth—
(1) the items of gross income and adjusted
ordinary gross income, described in section
543, received by the corporation during such
year, and
(2) the names and addresses of the individuals
who owned, within the meaning of section
544 (relating to rules for determining stock
ownership), at any time during the last half of
such year more than 50 percent in value of the
outstanding capital stock of the corporation,
the personal holding company tax for such year
may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the
collection of such tax may be begun without assessment,
at any time within 6 years after the
return for such year was filed.
(g) Certain income tax returns of corporations
(1) Trusts or partnerships
If a taxpayer determines in good faith that
it is a trust or partnership and files a return
as such under subtitle A, and if such taxpayer
is thereafter held to be a corporation for the
taxable year for which the return is filed, such
return shall be deemed the return of the corporation
for purposes of this section.
(2) Exempt organizations
If a taxpayer determines in good faith that
it is an exempt organization and files a return
as such under section 6033, and if such taxpayer
is thereafter held to be a taxable organization
for the taxable year for which the return
is filed, such return shall be deemed the
return of the organization for purposes of this
section.
(3) DISC
If a corporation determines in good faith
that it is a DISC (as defined in section 992(a))
and files a return as such under section
6011(c)(2) and if such corporation is thereafter

of a corporation which is not a DISC for purposes
of this section.

the expiration of the period within which a
deficiency for the taxable year of the net operating

disallowed foreign oil and gas taxes), such deficiency
may be assessed at any time before the
expiration of one year after the expiration of the
period within which a deficiency may be assessed
for the taxable year of the excess taxes
described in section 904(c) or 907(f) which result

such term by section 6511(d)(4)(C).
(k) Tentative carryback adjustment assessment
period
In a case where an amount has been applied,
credited, or refunded under section 6411 (relating
to tentative carryback and refund adjustments)
by reason of a net operating loss carryback, a
capital loss carryback, or a credit carryback (as
defined in section 6511(d)(4)(C)) to a prior taxable

this section for assessing a deficiency for such
prior taxable year shall be extended to include

whichever is applicable; except that the amount
which may be assessed solely by reason of this
subsection shall not exceed the amount so applied,
credited, or refunded under section 6411,
reduced by any amount which may be assessed
solely by reason of subsection (h) or (j), as the
case may be.
